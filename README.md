The owner collected weekly data of  different products bought by different customers in his store from the analysis which summed up to 7500 instances.

##### Goal of the Project:
Data analyst is to determine the products the customers are most likely going to buy together, so as to maximize the chance of a customer getting the deals/discounts.
